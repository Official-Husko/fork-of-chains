<p>
The unnamed swathing fields reaching up into the cold mountains of the north.
The northerners and the werewolf folks live in this area.
</p>

<p>
Deep within the snowy glades, the elusive <b>Foxkin</b> are bred and kept in secluded kennels.
Once wild spirits of the forest, these submissive demi-humans now live in service,
often raised as pets or companions under the watchful eye of the dominant werewolf tribes.
Their soft fur, obedient temperament, and innate fertility make them a coveted treasure
for those who can earn the Kennelsâ€™ trust.
